<!-- ## Difficulties/Unsolved Problems
- the orignal recipe API the app utilized was shut down in November 2019 and had to be replaced by the Edamam API.
- The heroku version of the app is not as functional as the local version as Edamam's API only works localy.
- The homepage search button is not redirecting to login as it originally did.
- Users are able to add multiples of the same ingredient when they shouldn't be allowed to. -->

## Future Development
- Allowing users to edit a contact's data
- Adding a Jest/RTL testing file to ensure the project's reliability
- Allowing users to delete a contact
- Error handling to validate form input and show a user a helpful error message
- Add images for a contact
- Open email when the contact's email is clicked
- Call phone number when the contact's phone number is clicked
